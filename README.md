##  What is this?
A WIP native app for browsing what SpaceX is up to. Features stack navigation, tab navigation, and a modern querying library.

## What was it built with?
React Native, Redux, React-Query, and Typescript, and SpaceXData's API.

## What was the most difficult part?
So far, wrapping my head around react-query's structure and behavior and working out some native-specific debugging methods.
